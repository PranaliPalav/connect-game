Connect 4 - Be the First to Four!
This is a classic two-player Connect 4 game implementation with an AI opponent and difficulty levels. Test your skills and strategize to connect four of your pieces before your opponent!

  Human vs. AI: Challenge yourself against three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
  Connect 5 Extension (Optional): Modify the code to play Connect 5 for an even greater strategic challenge.

Difficulty Levels:
Easy: The AI prioritizes placing its pieces randomly.
Medium: The AI prioritizes placing its own pieces to create potential winning lines while trying to block the human player.
Hard: The AI employs a minimax algorithm to analyze potential moves and strategically choose the best option to win or block the human player.

Connect 5 Extension:
The code can be modified to change the winning condition from connecting four pieces to five. This may involve adjusting board size, win condition checking logic, and potentially the AI algorithm for higher difficulty settings.
